summarize: CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not applicable STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH Not applicable SEQUENCE LISTING Not applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a method and apparatus for placing in-ground piles of either crushed stone or rock, grout or concrete, or some combination thereof. 2. Description of Prior Art It has been known in the prior art, to make pilings from concrete by casting them in place in the ground. This is accomplished by driving an elongate mandrel, i.e., a hollow tube of a selected cross-sectional area, into the ground, filling the resultant hole with fluid grout, and then pulling the mandrel back out of the ground leaving the grout in place to cure. The holding ability of such a piling comes from end-bearing and from the friction which is created by the close contact between the pile&#39;s sidewalls and the surrounding soil. It has also become standard practice to place a foot, aka, pile driving shoe, having a larger cross-sectional area than the mandrel, at the bottom of the mandrel before it is driven into the ground. The foot forms an open space around the mandrel. The hole created by the driving of the mandrel is filled with grout, i.e., cementitious fluid, stones, or rock. In the prior art grout may be gravity fed into and/or around the mandrel as it is being driven into the ground. See, e.g., Steding, U.S. Pat. No. 3,851,485 and Poma, U.S. Pat. No. 4,018,056. A significant problem with the gravity feed method is that the grout often cannot flow into the hole fast enough to keep up with its formation, thereby resulting in voids. If soil or objects in the soil fall into these voids, the resultant pile diameter will neck down at the locations of the voids, weakening the pile. Other prior art devices have attempted to overcome this problem by pumping the grout into the mandrel under positive pressure as the mandrel is being driven. See, e.g., Hochstrasser, U.S. Pat. No. 3,084,518 and Federer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,618,289. However, pumping grout is also very problematic due to the inability to maintain a sufficient volumetric flow rate due to grout&#39;s the high viscosity. Accordingly, pumping is sometimes no more effective than gravity filling. A twist on the gravity fed approach is seen in DeWitt, U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,002. In DeWitt, the mandrel is filled with grout prior to driving into the ground. A irretrievable steel foot is placed at the bottom the mandrel, which prevents the premature release of the grout. When the desired depth is reached, the mandrel is lifted out of the ground, leaving the foot behind and the grout flows out the bottom of the mandrel. All of the aforementioned approaches are subject to the problem of necking, because no exterior reinforcing casing is provided. The grout will be still be subject to necking as the mandrel is withdrawn. Without an exterior reinforcing casing there is no reinforcement against side-loading from earth movements, wind and other influences. Accordingly, excess concrete or grout must be pumped at the top of the hole to prevent the collapse of the hole. This adds to the cost of the pile. To provide the necessary reinforcement, the use of a full-length exterior reinforcing casing has been adopted in some circumstances. However, this is also less than ideal because the exterior casing is permanently left in the ground, thereby increasing the costs for each pile. Moreover, the aforementioned prior art devices suffer from lack of durability. All of the prior art devices teach the use of pile driving a single mandrel into the earth. Accordingly, the mandrel must be made of very sturdy material such as heavy steel to withstand the blows of the pile driving hammer and the resultant reactionary forces of the earth. It is not uncommon for such mandrels, despite their sturdiness, to deflect during the driving process, which in turn will lead to inadequate pile formation or lost time. In time, such mandrels may have to be scrapped because they have lost their straightness or because they cannot withstand the blows of the pile driver. This is wasteful and expensive. Additionally, the aforementioned devices do not accommodate the attachment of a vibrator without the need to halt the process. A vibrator is often used to assist in the delivery of pile forming material, such as stone, crushed rock or aggregate, or some combination thereof, into the resultant hole. The vibrator is clamped on to the mandrel and vibrates the mandrel. Prior to initiating the vibrator, the pile driving hammer must be lifted off of the mandrel to prevent damage to the pile driver. This results in additional delay in the pile forming process and consequently results in additional costs for the installation of the pile. Also as can be seen in the above discussion, the foregoing prior art devices are specific for certain types of materials, for example, the DeWitt device can only be utilized for installing piles made of grout, but not stone. Accordingly, a pile forming enterprise must have access to separate apparatuses depending on the requirements of the job. This increases inventory costs, overhead and capital outlay. What is needed is a single apparatus that is more durable when compared with single mandrel embodiments, that eliminates the need for an external casing that is left in the ground, that can be used in multiple piling forming situations, grout, stone, crushed rock, etc., and that can utilize a retrievable foot. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is an apparatus and a method for either casting a pile in the ground or placing a stone column into the ground. Prior art methods incorporate driving a single mandrel, with a disposable driving boot. The present invention comprises a retrievable exterior driving casing and an interior mandrel and an optional retrievable driving boot as the situation requires. The exterior casing is sized to the desired hole dimensions and the interior mandrel is filled with grout, stone (crushed or un-crushed), sand, cement or some combination thereof. The interior mandrel is sized so as to easily slide along the interior annular space of the exterior casing. The apparatus is driven into the ground using known pile driving methods. During penetration into the soil, depending on the type of soil encountered and the type of pile to be formed, grout, air or water flows into the surrounding earth through aligned apertures on the exterior casing and the interior mandrel; this prevents necking, and provides a temporary frictionless medium to allow easy extraction of the apparatus. When the bottom of the apparatus reaches the desired depth, the interior mandrel is lifted out of phase relative to the exterior casing by raising it a predetermined distance relative to the exterior casing. This allows the pile forming materials to flow out the bottom of the apparatus. After lifting the interior mandrel a certain distances, the exterior casing is caused to be lifted. The exterior casing maintains the integrity of hole as the pile forming material flows into the space created by the apparatus. Accordingly, the tendency to form voids and necks is substantially reduced. Additionally, because the apparatus comprises an exterior casing and an interior mandrel, the tubes may be made of thinner walled material than a conventional single mandrel, with the added advantage that the double tubes will be sturdier than a single mandrel having a thicker wall. This characteristic of double wall construction has been shown in performance and durability of double walled aluminum baseball bats when compared with single walled aluminum baseball bats. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken into conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.

summarize: TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates to scaffolding for supporting platforms, walkways, and formwork, and in particular the present invention relates to scaffolding for the building and construction industry. BACKGROUND [0002] Traditionally scaffolding systems are used during the construction and/or maintenance of large structures, for example buildings, silos, ships, monuments and dams etc. Scaffolding is erected generally on the outside of such structures, however, internal use is not uncommon. The scaffolding, once erected, provides practical access to areas of the structure that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible to reach. Generally, such areas are at a height beyond the reach of practical ladder and platform access. Such systems allow tradespeople to work at heights above a ground or base construction level safely and effectively, and also allow the safe storage and placement of trades materials. The traditional systems are commonly erected from the ground upwards, whereby upright poles are supported on the ground and interconnected via a network of cross-members and/or platforms to give stability and rigidity to the framework arrangement. As the lower levels of a structure are completed or as maintenance work moves upwards, it is commonly necessary to extend the scaffolding accordingly. This often requires connecting further uprights to the original ground supported uprights, with further interconnecting cross-members etc to add stability. As the system gains height it may be necessary to tie or fix the scaffolding into the structure for further safety and stability. Once assembled, the traditional form of scaffolding is fixed to the structure and cannot be moved without substantial, if not total disassembly. Thus, as work on the structure extends continues upwards, the lower levels of the scaffolding can become redundant, wasting materials that are not in use and requiring further materials to be brought in to continue extending the scaffolding and thus work at higher levels. [0003] Solutions to these problems have been previously proposed by so-called ‘second generation’ systems. One system known in the art is a detachable ‘jump’ or ‘hanging’ scaffolding system. In such a system the scaffolding is erected to a limited height extent and anchored in situ to the structure. As work proceeds upwards to higher construction or maintenance levels, the scaffolding can be detached from the structure and hoisted one unit at a time by crane to the required new height. Each scaffolding unit is then reset and re-attached to the structure at the new height. However, such systems are only able to accommodate scaffolding units of an area approximately 3 to 4 metres square due to the limiting practicalities in lifting and moving large sections of unitary scaffolding by crane. Commonly, by their very nature, such systems are employed in urban or built up areas having limited clearance or safety zones. Also, any lifting, moving and refixing operations necessarily need to take into account the prevailing weather conditions up until the scaffolding is safely refixed. During poor weather conditions, for example high winds or limited visibility it is impractical and unsafe to have a large scaffolding unit suspended in free space from a crane. Re-attachment would also prove difficult and may be considered dangerous in such circumstances. Due to the aforementioned impracticalities in moving sections of such a system, the units need to be smaller than would otherwise be desirable, therefore requiring a larger number of the units, and correspondingly a greater number of crane movements or additional cranes to move them. A high number of scaffolding units, along with the associated problems in moving such units has implications of increased construction time and costs along with an additional safety risk associated with moving the units in free space by crane. [0004] An alternative system proposed is the automated or ‘self-climbing’ system. Such systems are commonly a self-climbing assembly used primarily as a vertical wall formwork for forming concrete surfaces. U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,287 issued to Schwörer discloses such a system of “self climbing” formwork for erecting a concrete wall. The system includes a scaffolding platform that is moved by hydraulic linear drives along upright carrier rails mounted to a section of the wall, one linear drive per rail. Once the platform is driven to the top of its respective rails, it is maintained in that position whilst the rails are subsequently moved upwardly and fixed to the next section of wall. Thus, to advance the platform upwards the system requires a relatively complex two step process of alternately moving the platform, then the rails, then the platform etc. [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 4,060,358 issued to Fougea is a further known system of self climbing formwork. This system discloses the use of hydraulic actuators to advance and position a formwork frame along a wall under construction. The frame is provided with multiple hydraulic actuators, each attached at one end thereof to move the frame along the wall, the other end of each actuator being adapted to hook onto brackets mounted to the wall. During movement of the frame, cams in the form of ramps engage with the brackets to maintain the frame in a required position. Sliding bearing arms are then needed to be placed in position to support the frame and thereafter need to be removed to permit the frame to be advanced upwardly relative to the wall. [0006] Thus, unlike the previously described systems, self climb systems, which are required to make relatively small, incremental movements along a wall under construction to enable accurate positioning of the formwork, are not moved by crane, rather they are shifted automatically by in-built hydraulic jacks or rams. Although such systems avoid the aforementioned problems associated with hoisting units in free space by crane, they are comparatively expensive and also complex and difficult to install. Commonly, such systems require multiple hydraulic actuators which also need to be synchronised in order to maintain consistent, unhindered movement of the frame without jamming on the rails. [0007] It that would therefore be advantageous to provide a scaffolding system that reduces the aformentioned problems and limitations associated with the prior art systems. [0008] It would further be advantageous to provide a method for positioning a scaffolding system that reduces the aformentioned problems associated with the prior art systems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] Thus it would be advantageous to provide a simplified scaffolding system wherein a scaffolding assembly is simultaneously guided during raising and/or lowering and removably retained to a structure, and also supported following repositioning. [0010] Therefore in one aspect the present invention provides a scaffolding system including; a scaffold assembly including a plurality of connected elongate members, said members including support portions, and said assembly having an upper and a lower end; a plurality of brackets for mounting directly or indirectly to a structure, said brackets including retaining means for releasably retaining said elongate members in a lengthwise upright orientation when mounted to a structure, said brackets including support means for supporting at least part of the weight of said elongate members; guides for guiding the assembly during raising and/or lowering of the assembly relative to the structure; and a moving means separate from the scaffold assembly, the moving means attaching to the scaffold assembly via a tie element such that said assembly is suspended from said moving means and said moving means is arranged to pull said assembly upwards via said tie element during raising and to position the assembly at a predetermined position on said support means; and wherein the support means of said brackets are arranged to allow passage of said support portions during raising of the assembly but prevent passage of said support portions during lowering of the assembly to thereby support said assembly at the predetermined position. [0016] Thus, the present invention advantageously provides a scaffolding system that reduces the problems of positioning and fixing movable scaffolding assemblies associated with the aforementioned prior art systems. [0017] Preferably the moving means attaches proximate the upper end of the scaffold assembly via the tie element. [0018] In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a scaffolding system including; a scaffold assembly including a plurality of connected elongate members, said members including support portion, and said assembly having an upper and lower end; a plurality of brackets for mounting directly or indirectly to a structure, said brackets including retaining means for releasably retaining said elongate members in a lengthwise upright orientation when mounted to a structure, said brackets including support means for supporting at least part of the weight of said elongate members, each support means including a receiving bracket extending therefrom; and guides for guiding the assembly during raising and/or lowering of the assembly relative to the structure; and wherein, the support means are adapted to independently allow passage of said support portions when acted upon by the support portions during raising of the assembly, and the support means are adapted to independently prevent passage of said support portions during lowering of the assembly to thereby support said assembly and said receiving brackets are

summarize: BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] (1) Field of the Invention [0002] The invention relates to an apparatus and method for the repair of failure spots along a first tubular conduit, such as casing, in a subterranean well. [0003] (2) Brief Description of the Prior Art [0004] Subterranean wells, such as oil, gas or water wells, oftentimes are completed with the introduction and cementing in place a long string of tubular sections of metallic casing. Since the expected production life of such a well has been known to last decades, and in view of the fact that the abrasive well fluids and treatment chemicals flowing interiorally of the casing often result in defects, such as small holes, pock marks leading to small holes and cracks, (“failure spots”) it is not at all surprising that a failure in circulation of the fluids oftentimes results, with the holes eventually getting larger and larger and even penetrating through the cement securing the casing within the well. It is therefore necessary from time to time to inspect the casing for such defects and attempt to repair them, as opposed to retrieving the entire casing string and running and setting another string of casing. [0005] The present invention addresses the problems as set forth above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention provides a well tool and method for heating a low and higher temperature melting metal alloy charge for the repair of failure spots along a section of a first tubular conduit, such as, for example, casing. The well tool comprises an elongated housing having a cylindrical interior chamber and a lower end. The chamber is formed by first and sections therein. The housing also has proximate its lower end a circumferentially extending dissolvable sacrificial wall means for initially isolating the chambers from the exterior of the housing and, upon melting of the metal alloys, providing a passageway through the housing to permit the alloys to flow out of the housing and into the well. A first, low temperature melting eutectic metal alloy charge is deposited within one of the first and second sections of the chamber. A second, higher temperature melting metal alloy charge is deposited within the other of the first and second sections of the chamber. The second, higher temperature metal alloy charge produces, upon melting, a metal precipitate, which, in turn, is used, in combination with the first metal alloy charge, to repair the failure spots, as hereinafter described. Means are provided at one end of the housing for introducing, positioning and retrieving the tool within the well. An ignitable fuel system is also carried within the chamber. Finally, means for igniting the fuel system is provided, whereby, upon activation of the igniting means, the fuel system is ignited sufficient to heat and melt the first lower temperature melting eutectic metal alloy charge and thereafter sufficient to heat and melt the second higher temperature melting metal alloy charge to produce the metal precipitate, such as iron, whereby, upon said melting of said alloy charges, the sacrificial wall is dissolved to provide said passageway for the flow of the first metal alloy and the precipitate through the housing and into the well. [0007] The tool and method of its use further includes a number of additional features and steps, provided by other elements. For example, the tool may include a ceramic or other heat resistant plug carried on said well tool at the lower end of the housing and positionable within the well for bridging the failure spots on the tubular conduit. Upon completion of the operation and method, the plug is caused to be separated or released from the housing, and the housing is retrieved to the top surface of the well and the plug is left in position within the well. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008] FIG. 1 is a vertical longitudinal sectional schematic view of a section of casing including failure spots to be repaired. [0009] FIG. 2 is a view similar to that of FIG. 1, illustrating the insertion of the well tool of the present invention with a plug having retainer seal disposed at its lower end to form an annular area between the first conduit or casing conduit and the exterior of the plug. [0010] FIG. 3 is an illustration similar to that of FIGS. 1 and 2, and depicting the opening of the sacrificial wall after activation of the tool to melt the metal alloys and provide the metal precipitate and permit the precipitate of the high temperature metal alloy to flow through the passageway provided by the opening of the wall, providing a bridge for flow of the lower temperature melting alloy to seek, fill and cover the failure spots. [0011] FIG. 4 is an illustration similar to that of FIG. 1, illustrating the repaired casing conduit after the well tool housing has been retrieved, the failure spots repaired, and the plug remaining in place. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0012] Now referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a subterranean well W. The well W includes previously run and set a first conduit string or casing C- 1. As shown the casing string C- 1 has a series of small holes or defects H located longitudinally and radially around a section of the casing C- 1. [0013] As shown in FIG. 2, the apparatus 100 of the present invention is preferably run into the well W on wire line 101, of conventional and known nature. Alternatively, it may be run into the well W on tubing or electric line. If means other than electric line are used to run and set the apparatus 100, an electric line 103 is provided form the top of the well W and connected to a source of electric energy at the top or other location in the well W and is connected at the lower end to an electric starter charge 104 within an upper chamber section 105 within an elongated housing 106. The housing preferably is made of metal, such as an alloy steel or the like. The chamber section 105 is the uppermost portion of a continuing cylindrical interior chamber 107 defined within the interior of the housing 106. A one-way check valve 108 is positioned at the upper end of the housing 106 to vent pressure exceeding a pre-set limit within the housing 106 during ignition of the ignition fuel charge required to activate the apparatus 100. The chamber 107 also has a lower chamber section 105 A including a section of a circumferentially extending dissolvable sacrificial wall means 105 A- 1 for initially isolating the chamber 107 from the exterior of the housing 106, and, upon melting of the metal alloys, providing a passageway 105 A- 2 ( FIG. 3 ) for flow of the metal alloys into the well W. A ceramic, or other high temperature resistant plug 110 is secured, but selectively removable from, the lowermost end of the housing 106, by means of shear pins 105 A- 2. At the lowermost end of the plug 110 is a circumferentially extending exterior elastomeric seal means 110 A which, when the apparatus 100 is positioned within the well W for operation, will define an annulus area AN between the exterior of the plug 110 and the interior wall or surface C- 1 A of the casing C- 1. [0014] The chamber 107 within the housing 106 contains a homogeneous stabilized ignition or fast burning fuel charge 109. Any commercially available source of a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum, which is used in, for example, explosives for perforating guns or like actuations within a subterranean well, may be used. Additives which assist in the burning of a material under water, such as boron nitrate may also be added. The fuel charge 109 may also include an additive such as magnesium for more controlled burning. The aluminum may be finely ground to increase the rate of burn. However, it is preferable to retard the bum rate of this fuel 109 so that energy is not lost in the exhaust. To control the rate of burn of the fuel 109 to achieve maximum burn without excessive exhaust loss, a binder, such as starch, may be added to slow the rate of burn, as well as an additive that expands upon heating to raise the melting point of the fuel mixture charge 109 and to permit the fuel charge 109 to harden quickly as it is introduced into the housing 107. Such expansion and hardening agents are commercially available from a host of sources and are well known to those skilled in the fuel composite arts for well tool usage. [0015] The invention contemplates use of two metal alloy substances, or charges, for providing the molten metal composite and precipitate for repair of the failure spots H in the well W. The first, or lower temperature melting eutectic metallic alloy LTA is deposited into the first, or uppermost chamber section 105 above the uppermost end of a second, higher

summarize: FIELD [0001] This disclosure relates to a screen adjustable in height and/or shape for use in a urinal and assemblies that incorporate the screen. BACKGROUND [0002] Water conservation is a major concern in many areas and is likely to become even more important in the future as populations increase resulting in more water consumption. The largest daily user of water in commercial establishments is the urinal, while other restroom fixtures contribute to the overall high water consumption of commercial establishments. [0003] In order to reduce water consumption, low water and no-water fixtures, such as urinals, have been devised. These no-water and low water fixtures are not flushed each time a person uses the fixture and, in fact, are oftentimes not equipped for flushing as they are not connected to a water supply. As a no-water urinal is repeatedly used, most urine is collected in a compartment of the urinal. Oil sealing liquids, such as organic oils lighter than and immiscible with urine, float on the surface of the collected urine and act as a barrier to prevent odors from escaping. Screens are used to block the collected urine, and any urine or liquid remaining in the urinal, from sight. [0004] Typical screens used in urinals are generally flat sheets completely encircling or covering the drain. The bottom of the screen typically forms a seal with the bottom surface of the urinal. Any liquid (i.e., water, urine) must therefore pass through the perforations of the screen to go down the drain. When there is resting water and urine in the urinal, the perforations, however, have a tendency to get clogged with debris and garbage, restricting liquid flow and resulting in visible standing liquid in the urinal. The standing liquid is unpleasant to view and often emits a foul odor. [0005] It is desirable to provide a urinal screen which is adjustable in height and/or shape to cover or conceal unsightly resting water and urine while also protecting drains from debris and garbage whether in a flat or raised position. It is further desirable to provide a urinal screen which may be used over existing screens (typically those that are affixed to drains with screws) to conceal the existing screen while also protecting drains from debris and deodorizing. SUMMARY [0006] The present disclosure provides a urinal screen for protecting drains from debris and garbage that can clog pipes, which can optionally be used with additional cleaner/deodorizer blocks, and can be modified in shape to conceal and avoid interference with already installed screens, resting water/urine and/or other drain components. The screen assembly can be used to cover up unsightly urine/water so that it is not viewed by the user. The assembly provides for integration of a screen with cleaning materials (e.g., enzymes, bacteria) in a solid block, gel or liquid form, with or without fragrance additives. The flexibility of the screen allows the assembly to confirm to any urinal shape or other variable surface on which the assembly would be installed to provide a trap screen and ensure that little or no debris enters the drain. The conforming properties of the flexible screen design ensure that the screen lies flat on the contact surface to prevent splashing of urine. [0007] In an embodiment, the disclosure provides a urinal screen, comprising a flexible screen in a circular configuration comprising a center portion and a contiguous outer portion encircling the center portion, the outer portion being separated into one or more elongate strips extending outwardly from the center portion, and the center portion having a center hole extending therethrough, wherein when positioned on a surface of a urinal, the screen is substantially conformable to the urinal surface. In embodiments, the center portion of the screen can be elevated such that the screen is in a mound- or dome-like configuration. [0008] In embodiments of the screen, the outer portion can be structured as a plurality of elongated strips extending radially outward from and in a perpendicular orientation to the center portion, as one or more elongated strips in a spiral configuration, or as a plurality of strips in a zigzag configuration extending outwardly from the center portion, among other configurations. In an embodiment, the outer portion is composed of zigzagged strips with a plurality of bent arm portions connected together at an angle. [0009] In embodiments, the screen can be connected to a module for containing a material (e.g., block, gel or liquid) containing a cleaning agent, fragrance or a combination thereof. [0010] In some embodiments, the urinal screen, with or without a module containing a cleaning/fragrance material, can be combined with an arched support stand, such that the screen is situated over the support stand in a domed configuration. [0011] In an embodiment, a urinal screen assembly according to the disclosure comprises a flexible screen in a circular configuration comprising a center portion and a contiguous outer portion encircling the center portion, the outer portion being separated into one or more elongated strips extending outwardly from the center portion, and the center portion having a center hole extending therethrough; and at least one of a) a fastening element sized for insertion through the center hole of the screen, b) an arched support stand sized for placement of the screen thereover in a domed configuration, and c) a module for containing a cleaner or fragrance block, configured for attachment to the flexible screen. In embodiments, the outer portion of the screen comprises a plurality of elongated strips extending radially outwardly from the center portion.

-END CONTEXT-
summarize: BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a collecting device for dog droppings. Whereas in recent centuries man has succeeded in obtaining satisfactory hygienic conditions for human facilities by the further development of domestic sanitary technology and municipal sewage technology, the situation is still that of the darkest Middle Ages, to use the words of a well-known hygiene expert, when the approach to the problem of dog droppings, in particular in towns, is considered. For as in the past, the usual practice is simply to take the dog for a walk in the street and with the increasing number of dogs, frequently large ones, this leads to a considerable nuisance to the public and even endangers health. Simply prohibiting contamination of parks and pavements is not a solution. The attempt to master the problem with a shovel and paper bag has not resulted in any appreciable success, at least in Germany. Moreover, removing dog droppings with the aid of a small shovel can be very difficult for elderly persons, many of whom are dog owners. As for any other dog owner, for such persons it would be a great help to have a device at their disposeal which when taking the dog for a walk can be carried along without any difficulty and at the same time permits safe discreet removal of the droppings of the owner&#39;s dog in simple manner as well as hygienic final disposal. The problem underlying the invention is to provide such a device. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This problem is solved by a collecting device for dog droppings as described in the main claim. Advantageous further developments are set forth in the subsidiary claims and for a definition of the terms used and further explanation reference is made to the following description. The collecting device according to the invention for dog droppings has the form of a walking-stick whose lower end is widened in bell-shaped manner, &#34;bell-shaped&#34; having the broadest sense within the scope of the present invention and covering circular bodies open towards the ground surface of almost any desired shape, for example hemispheres, cylinders, truncated cones or the like. The wall may be closed all round but can also be perforated or basket-like. The peripheral edge of said bell-shaped widening substantially takes up the forces occurring when leaning on a walking-stick and for this reason the bell-shaped widening in the present description is referred to as &#34;support bell&#34;. The interior of said support bell is formed towards the bottom by a further part formed by at least two portions and referred to within the scope of the present invention as &#34;receiving insert&#34;, the characteristic feature of which is that it is formed from at least two interconnected circular sector-shaped plates pivotal with respect to each other in such a manner that the lower bottom of the support bell is either open in sector-shaped manner, preferably in semi-circle form, or by pivoting the one movable plate closed to form a solid circle. Said receiving insert is preferably detachably connected to a rotatable extension of the stick led through the support bell in such a manner that rotation of said extension effects pivoting of the movable sector-shaped plate. In the simplest case the receiving insert is a circular disc made up of the two plate members and having a central plug-type connection piece for the plugging in or on of the extension of the stick. The normal position before use of the collecting means according to the invention is such that the pivotal plate is pivoted behind or in front of the other plate arrested in the support bell so that the bottom face is partially opened. This open face is set down over a heap of droppings, whereafter by turning the extension the pivotal plate is pivoted and moves beneath the droppings, collecting them in the interior of the support bell. In a simplest embodiment the extension is simply the extended end of the stick which is led rotatably through th upper side of the support bell and inserted in slip-free manner into a slightly resilient plug-type connection piece on the rotatable plate. When the support bell, the edge of which can be given any desired shape to improve adhesion to the ground, is pressed against the ground and the walking-stick with the movable plate turned, collection of the droppings is completed. In this position the stick is preferably locked with respect to the support bell by a detent means or the like so that the device can be again used as walking-stick without any risk of the dog excrements dropping out again. Although the embodiment just described comes under the scope of protection of the present invention as set forth by the claims, the preferred embodiment is however the more complicated one described below with reference to the Figures. However, it is readily within the scope of the technical understanding of an expert or an interested layman to modify the simplest embodiment just described to a greater or lesser extent using elements of the more complicated embodiment described as example. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Hereinafter the invention will be described with the aid of a preferred embodiment with reference to the Figures, wherein: FIG. 1 is a view of a general embodiment of the device according to the invention; FIG. 2 is a partial view of the means according to the invention in a preferred embodiment with the securing elements for the receiving member, which is not inserted; FIG. 3 shows a box-shaped receiving member fitting the device shown in FIG. 2; and FIG. 4 shows the grip portion of a device according to the invention which matches the support bell according to the partial view of FIG. 2. FIG. 1 shows the basic elements of the collecting device according to the invention. These are a stick 1, a support bell 2 open on the ground side, an extension 3 which extends the stick 1 and is rotatable together with said stick 1 or independently thereof with respect to the support bell 2 and which is connected to a receiving insert 4 which consists of at least two circular sector-shaped, in this case substantially semicircular, plates 5 and 6 which are pivotal with respect to each other, one of the plates 5 substantially retaining its position with respect to the support bell 2 whilst the plate 6 is pivotal above or below the plate 5. The pivoting of the plate 6 is by rotating the extension 3 which is inserted into or onto a plug-type connecting piece 7. The receiving insert 4 is detachably connected to the extension 3 and is generally a disposable article. For reasons of clarity FIG. 1 shows a state through which the collecting means passes during closing. Usually, before the means is used the sector-shaped plate 6 is behind the plate 5 whilst after use it completely closes the bottom face of the support bell 2 with the dog droppings collected therein. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The simplest embodiment shown in FIG. 1 has only an interchangeable bottom plate although the inner walls of the support bell 2 can also be protected by disposable parts possibly to be replaced less often. In FIG. 1 the securing on the extension 3 is by simple insertion into a matching plug-type connecting sleeve 7 on the plate 6 which is rotatably connected with an eye or the like to the plate 5. Although this embodiment is of greater simplicity it has a number of disadvantages which are obviated in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2 to 4. FIG. 2 shows a support bell 2 in which the stick 1 is made tubular and terminates on the upper side of the housing 11 for an electric motor. The shaft of the electric motor forms in this case part of the extension 3. The shaft 8 is tubular and slit once or more in the longitudinal direction. Extending through its axis into the hollow tubular stick 1 is a core rod 9 which is movable in the axial direction and which comprises at its end a thickening or projecting which interact with corresponding associated faces of the tubular shaft 8 in such a manner that the portions lying between the slits are expanded when the core rod 9 is moved in the axial direction towards one side. The thickening or the projections can have any desired known forms. Thus, the thickening may be a sphere, a ball or a similar conical body which cooperates with correspondingly inclined or curved faces of the tubular shaft 8 and thus expands said tubular shaft 8. Instead of one projection however projections or similar wedges can be provided extending in correspondingly formed slits in the tubular shaft 8. By pulling the core rod 9 against the engagement faces of the tubular shaft 8 the latter is expanded. In the device according to the invention the core rod 9 is usually biased in the sense of expansion of the tubular shaft 8, for example with the aid of a mechanism as shown in FIG. 4 and located in the grip portion of the stick 1. In this mechanism a pressure spring 12 pushes the core rod 9 upwardly. By actuating a lever 10 the core rod 9 is moved downwardly, overcoming the spring force, and this leads to the resilient tubular shaft 8 no longer being expanded and its diameter being reduced. Since, as explained
